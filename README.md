## Introduction

The project features a Neural Network capable of evaluating a board position & NegaMax algorithm to find optimum move.
Additionally, it offers classic Chess game for player-versus-player matches. 

## Technologies Used:
- ### Tensorflow:
   In our chess engine, TensorFlow is utilized for loading and running the pre-trained neural network model, which evaluates the board position.
- ### Negamax Algorithm with alpha beta pruning:
  Negamax is a variant of the minimax algorithm used for game tree search. It is enhanced with alpha-beta pruning, which improves its efficiency by eliminating branches of the game tree that are known to be worse than the best found so far.
- ### Python-chess module:
  The Python-chess module is utilized for board manipulation, move generation, and legality checking, facilitating the implementation of the game logic and the Negamax search algorithm.
- ### Data Preprocessing:
  Data preprocessing includes converting the chess board position into a format compatible with the neural network input, such as a multi-dimensional array representing the state of the board.

## How can I execute my project?

To get started with the Chess Game, follow these simple steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Install the required dependencies using `pip install`.

- Execute 'ChessMain.py'.
